#Description of the project:
#	in this Project i'm working as a team with Oladapo Odedeyi
#	This is a clone of the AirBnb website, but the console of the site
#	in the future this will be integrated with other parts of the website
#	which include the html and database and other parts which iinclude API
#	integration using flasks and other software

#Description of the command interpreter:
#	the command line interpreter will basically be used for teting and for developer
# 	use, it will be used as a shelllike interpreter that takes in command and run
#	give an output and at the other end perform a particular task
#	to do this the cmd module is used that inherits a Cmd class

#How to start it:
#	To start it, a file with a code console will be written using the cmd module
#	to instanciate the commands and we will make sure the file cannot be imported but

#How to use it:
#	can only be runned
#	running the file ./console for example will start the program and take us
#	to an interactive section like the shell where we can run commands

# examples:
#	
#	$ ./console.py
#	(hbnb) help
#
#	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
#	========================================
#	EOF  help  quit
#
#	(hbnb) 
#	(hbnb) 
#	(hbnb) quit
#	$
#	But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
#	
#	$ echo "help" | ./console.py
#	(hbnb)	
#
